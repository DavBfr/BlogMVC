Leela's gonna kill me. It's a T. It goes \"tuh\". File not found. She also liked to shut up!\n\n## The Why of Fry\n\nI love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.\n\n*   So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct'\n*   No! The cat shelter's on to me.\n*   No, she'll probably make me do it.\n\n### My Three Suns\n\nOK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything.\n\n#### A Clockwork Origin\n\nYou can see how I lived before I met you. Can we have Bender Burgers again?

They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! Large bet on myself in round one. Actually, that's still true. Ask her how her day was. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
